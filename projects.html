  <h2>Projects</h2>
  <p>I am currently working in two areas:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Cultural Analytics</strong> – The use of computational, AI, and data science methods to study and analyze culture, particularly contemporary digital and online culture.</li>
    <li><strong>Cultural AI</strong> – The experimental testing of generative AI models to perform and enact cultural tasks and behaviors (e.g., authorship, interpretation), with the aim of improving AI systems through cultural insight and theory.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Cultural Analytics</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Fast Culture, Slow Justice</strong> (book in progress) – A case study of #BLM in 2020 that explores how platforms like Twitter and Wattpad transformed public storytelling and galvanized social movements.</li>
    <li><strong>Split Screens</strong> (with Tess McNulty and Hoyt Long, under review) – A study of the relationship between TV aesthetic preference/viewing and US political voting from 2016–2022, with a focus on polarization.</li>
    <li><strong>Cultural and Aesthetic Sources for Political and Social Behavior</strong> (with David Bamman, Hoyt Long, and Tess McNulty) – A series of papers combining machine vision analysis of popular TV shows with political/social data to understand how aesthetic and narrative preferences relate to political behavior.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Cultural AI</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>The Social AI Author</strong> (with Edwin Roland and Hoyt Long) – Generative AI simulations exploring how AI agents behave as authors and how they model social preferences and creative success.</li>
    <li><strong>Close Reading and LLM Co-intelligence</strong> (with Mina Lee, Jiayin Zhi, and Hoyt Long) – HCI experiments testing whether LLMs can enhance students' ability to close read and enjoy poetry.</li>
    <li><strong>Cultural AI: Building a New Research Field</strong> (with Aarthi Vadde) – A methodological paper outlining goals for enriching AI with humanistic insight and creating tools for cultural research.</li>
  </ul>
