    <h1>Projects</h1>

    <p>
      I am currently working in two areas: (1) <strong>Cultural Analytics</strong>, or the use of computational, AI, and data science methods to study and analyze culture, particularly contemporary digital and online culture, and (2) <strong>Cultural AI</strong>—the experimental testing of generative AI models to perform and enact cultural tasks and behavior, such as authorship and aesthetic interpretation, as a means to improving AI systems from the perspective of cultural insight and theory.
    </p>

    <h2>Cultural Analytics</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><em>Fast Culture, Slow Justice: Storytelling and Social Movements in the Digital Age</em> (book in progress) — A case study of #BLM in 2020 that explores how platforms like Twitter and Wattpad transformed public storytelling and their role in galvanizing social movements.</li>
      <li><em>Split Screens: Aesthetic Preference and Political Polarization</em> (with Tess McNulty and Hoyt Long, under review) — A study of the relationship between TV aesthetic preference/viewing and US political voting from 2016–2022, with a focus on polarization.</li>
      <li><em>Cultural and Aesthetic Sources for Political and Social Behavior</em> (with David Bamman, Hoyt Long, and Tess McNulty) — A series of papers (2016–present) combining machine vision analysis of popular TV shows with social/political data to understand how aesthetic and narrative preferences relate to political behavior.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Cultural AI</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><em>The Social AI Author</em> (with Edwin Roland and Hoyt Long) — Generative AI simulations designed to explore how AI agents behave as authors and how they model social preferences and creative success.</li>
      <li><em>Close Reading and LLM Co-intelligence</em> (with Mina Lee, Jiayin Zhi, and Hoyt Long) — Human-computer interaction experiments testing whether LLMs can enhance students' ability to close read and enjoy poetry.</li>
      <li><em>Cultural AI: Building a New Research Field</em> (with Aarthi Vadde) — A methodological paper outlining the goals of a new research area focused on enriching AI with humanistic insight and developing tools for cultural research.</li>
    </ul>
