  <h2>Projects</h2>

  <div class="project-area-description">
    I am currently working in two areas:
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Cultural Analytics</strong> – The use of computational, AI, and data science methods to study and analyze culture, particularly contemporary digital and online culture.</li>
      <li><strong>Cultural AI</strong> – The experimental testing of generative AI models to perform and enact cultural tasks and behaviors (e.g., authorship, interpretation), aiming to improve AI systems through cultural insight and theory.</li>
    </ul>
  </div>

  <h3>Cultural Analytics</h3>
  
  <div class="project-card">
    <strong>Fast Culture, Slow Justice</strong> (book in progress)  
    <p>A case study of #BLM in 2020 exploring how platforms like Twitter and Wattpad transformed public storytelling and galvanized social movements.</p>

  </div>

  <div class="project-card">
    <strong>Cultural and Aesthetic Sources for Political and Social Behavior</strong> (with David Bamman, Hoyt Long, and Tess McNulty)  
    <p>A series of papers combining machine vision analysis of popular TV shows with political/social data to understand how aesthetic and narrative preferences shape political behavior.</p>
  </div>

  <h3>Cultural AI</h3>

  <div class="project-card">
    <strong>The Social AI Author</strong> (with Edwin Roland and Hoyt Long)  
    <p>Generative AI simulations exploring how AI agents behave as authors and model social preferences and creative success.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="project-card">
    <strong>Close Reading and LLM Co-intelligence</strong> (with Mina Lee, Jiayin Zhi, and Hoyt Long)  
    <p>HCI experiments testing whether LLMs can enhance students' ability to close read and enjoy poetry.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="project-card">
    <strong>Cultural AI: Building a New Research Field</strong> (with Aarthi Vadde)  
    <p>A methodological paper outlining goals for enriching AI with humanistic insight and creating tools for cultural research.</p>
